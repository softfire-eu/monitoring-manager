Monitoring Manager
The Monitoring Manager provides proper resources to experimenters requiring monitoring service. For experimenters requiring monitoring services, the Monitoring Manager provides, via OpenBaton, the installation of an additional Virtual Machine pre-configured with Zabbix Server. All Virtual Machines requested by the experimenter will be installed with Zabbix Agent, per-configured to communicate with experimenterâ€™s Zabbix Server. The experimenters receive full administrations rights of Zabbix Server, in order to be able to configure the server according the specific needs of the experimenter.
